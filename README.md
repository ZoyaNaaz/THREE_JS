# THREE_JS Learning Guide

This repository is a **learning guide** for [three.js](https://threejs.org/), the powerful JavaScript 3D library. It contains a collection of simple, focused code experiments and examples, intended for educational purposes rather than as a production-ready project.

## About

The goal of this repository is to help you learn how to use three.js by exploring small, self-contained examples. Each file or folder demonstrates a particular concept or feature of three.js, such as rendering basic shapes, working with materials, adding lights, or creating simple animations.

**Note:** This is not a full-fledged application or framework, but a curated set of learning resources and code snippets to help you get started with three.js.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZoyaNaaz/THREE_JS.git
   ```
2. **Open the examples:**
   - You can open `.html` files directly in your browser, or
   - For best results (especially when loading local assets), use a simple HTTP server such as:
     ```bash
     npx http-server .
     ```
3. **Explore the code:**
   - Browse the files and folders in the repository.
   - Each example is self-contained and focuses on a single aspect of three.js.

## Structure

```
THREE_JS/
├── assets/           # Images, models, textures, etc.
├── src/              # Example JavaScript files and demos
├── index.html        # Example entry point (optional)
└── README.md         # This file
```

- Most learning examples can be found in the `src/` directory.

## How to Use This Guide

- Read the code in each example and try running it in your browser.
- Tweak parameters, change colors, or experiment with different objects and materials.
- Use the [three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/) and [examples](https://threejs.org/examples/) for deeper exploration.

## Who Is This For?

- Beginners to three.js or WebGL
- Anyone curious about how to create 3D graphics in the browser
- Learners who prefer hands-on code samples
